Full stack software engineer with experience in the  e-commerce, food industry and retail domains.  Proficient programming in JavaScript, Node.js and React and well versed in Agile methodologies and best practices.  Experienced in creating high-performance software solutions and adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams to drive project success.

Additional solid knowledge of Core Java, Ruby on Rails, SQL and Cloudflare services.

Its the numerous avenues and niches of adding value to other peoples lives and my own that have made transitioning into Software Engineering after working 10 years  in retail such a breath of fresh air.

I'm currently pursuing certification as a AWS Solutions Architect and keep a foot in the Hospitality world to stay grounded.

Aside from Software Engineering I would enjoy getting my feet wet in the areas of Business Analysis and content generation in the area of Ed Tech.
